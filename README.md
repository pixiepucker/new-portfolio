  ## Description
  This week's challenge was to revamp our portfolio's using REACT. Not only did I do that, I also researched and used new technologies like 'react-responsive-carousel' and Tailwind CSS to help me make my portfolio unique! Making this portfolio really tested my knowledge of REACT, how I search for solutions, and how to solve my design errors. I was able to make a more sophistaced portfolio that showcases my design style and is some of my best work! This entire project wouldn't have been possible without all the support from teaching staff, but from my classmates as well.

  Built With:
  - React.js
  - MongoDB
  - 'react-responsive-carousel'
  - JSX/HTML/CSS/Javascript

  ## Installation
  Please do not install my portfolio as it is not a template! However, if you do download the zip, all you'll need to do after you unzip it is run 'npm init-y', 'npm i', 'mongod',  and finally 'npm start' in the terminal.

  ## Usage
  REACT Portfolio to showcase my work.
